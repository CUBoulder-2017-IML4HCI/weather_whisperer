# weather_whisperer
This project uses machine learning to determine the color of an RGB LED strip controlled by an iPhone App and a Raspberry Pi.
We put the RGB LED strip inside a laser cut lamp (see below for pictures)
The user determines what color the lamp should be based on different temperatures, wind speends, and weather conditions (i.e. Partly Cloudy) by selecting different colors in the iPhone App. After the user has entered a small set of data points (currently 5) the lamp is ready to be turned on. The confidence of the color of the lamp is displayed to user as "Confident" or "Not Confident" depending on how similar the current weather is to weather in the training data. The user has the ability to add training points and retrain the algorithm. 

# Install Instructions 
First obtain a weather underground API key [here.](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)
Next create a database in [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) copying the below format. 
Make sure the names of the fields are the same.

## iPhone
The current edition of this app is for IOS and is built using Xcode. Xcode can be downloaded for free on all Apple computers. Xcode is not available for non-apple devices. 
First, if you do not already have xcode downloaded on your computer, go to the app store and download the program or go to this link https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
After you have downloaded Xcode, download the application named 'ww_app' by cloning or downloading this repository. After this is finished, go into the ww_app folder and open the file called 'ww_app.xcworkspace'. At this point you are ready to run the app! In the top left corner of Xcode, you will see a play button and stop button. Next to this you can see what simulator is currently being used and have the option to switch to a new simulator. Hit the play arrow button when you are ready to run the app.
If you would like to make changes to the app, all files can be found in the project navigator column on the left side of Xcode. Layout changes can be made using 'Main.storyboard' and changes to the code can be made by editing any of the '.swift' files.


## Board Setup

# Instructions for Use
Once the install and assembly instructions above have been completed the system is ready to be run. 
Log into the Pi controlling the weather station and the Pi controlling the RGB LED strip. In the following
code snippet in *wunderground_pi_firebase.py* update the host to be the ip address of the Pi controlling
the weather station and make sure that the port is the same as the port in the simple_server.py file on the Pi
controlling the weather station.

```python
def get_local_temp():
	s = socket.socket()        
	host = '192.168.20.100'# ip of raspberry pi 
	port = 12345               
	s.connect((host, port))
	temp = s.recv(1024)
	print(temp)
	s.close()
	return temp.decode('utf-16')
 ```
In the following code snippet in *wunderground_pi_firebase.py* update the Firebase API configuration to that of your Firebase
```python
#Firebase Configuration
config = {
  "apiKey": "apiKey",
  "authDomain": "weatherwhisperer.firebaseapp.com",
  "databaseURL": "https://weatherwhisperer.firebaseio.com",
  "storageBucket": "weatherwhisperer.appspot.com"
}
```
In Firebase, change pi_command to 'off' and led_state to 'OFF'
 ## Pi Controlling Weather Station
 Run the following command 
 ~~~ 
 python3 simple_server.py 
 ~~~
 
 ## Pi Controllng RGB LED Strip
 Run the following commands to access the GPIO pins and start the program
 ~~~
 sudo pigpiod
 python3 wunderground_pi_firebase.py [API KEY]
 ~~~
 
 ## Hardware for RGB LED Strip
 ~~~
 Schematic
 ~~~

To understand these instructions you will have to understand the shcematic and pictures shown above. 
Power Supply and Potentiometer:
 1. The ideal voltage for a RGB LED strip is 10 volts/9volts. If you have one of these skip to instruction .....
 2. With a voltage supply 11 volts and above continue reading.
 3. You will need a potentiometer that will need to be adjusted to 9.8 kÎ©
 4. Connect the power and the ground to the potentiometer 
 5. Then connect the input wire that is for the pi. 

P-Mosfets: 
 1. Make sure that these are P-Mosfets, if they are N-Mosfets the ..... will be switched
 2. 
 
 ## iPhone App
 If you enter Boulder, CO the temperature will be taken from Pi Weather Station instead of Weather Underground
 1. Enter the name of a city in the United States making sure to capitalize the first letter of each word in the city name 
 2. Enter the two letter state abbreviation
 3. Press the save button, weather information for that city will now appear on the main page of the app
 4. Press the color button select the color to display for the given weather data
 5. Press the save button
 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the 'Add Color' text changes to 'Ready to Train'
 7. Press the 'ON/OFF' button
 8. The RGB LED Strip should now turn on
 9. If the lamp is not confident in the predict color 'Not Confident' will be displayed
 10. Add the current data as a training point as described in Steps 4 and 5
 11. Enjoy customizing the lamp
